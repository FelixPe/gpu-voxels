Changelog of GPU-Voxels:

V 0.1 (2014-09-29):
===================
- Initial Version of GPU Voxels 
  (Please find a list of features on the Website or the according scientific papers or have a look at the example programs)
- Open Issue: Compiled only in Debug Mode

V 0.2 (2014-09-12):
===================
- Fixed compilation issued in Release Mode

V 0.3 (2015-02-26):
===================
- Made changes in the include structure to allow compilation with CUDA 6.5 (no longer trying to compile Boost-SharedMem-Headers with NVCC)
- Added datatype "PrimitiveArray" to quickly visualize helpers like thousands of spheres or cubes.
- Added InsertMetaPointCloud option to give each sub-cloud an own voxel type
- Function to sync a MetaPointCloud back to Host Memory
- Speed up in clearing VoxelMaps
- Added an optional offset when intersecting maps. So you can move one map relative to another before intersecting them.
- Added parameter to Kinect Interface to support the new PCL interface where a Cam ID has to be specified.
- More documentation in Octree kernels
- Added more operators for primitive data types
- Added Binvox as file format to generate Pointclouds
- Added Example program to demonstrate the insertion of IBEO Sensor Pointclouds
- Added missing config file for example program that intersects live Kinect data with a robot model (RobotVsEnvironment)
- Open Issues: Flickering colors in Visualization

V 0.4 (2015-03-09):
===================
- Fixed coordinate system in the Viewer
- Improved Viewer XML Config parser
- Added possibility to control visibility of SweptVolume subvolumes from a provider program
- Improved pointcloud file loader (new datatype, scaling)
- Improved example programs, added viwer configfile for them
- Added missing pointcloud filess for the examples
- Moved performance monitor to icl_core
- Some smaller fixes regarding RAD / DEG
- Removed compiler warnings

V 0.5 (2015-04-13):
===================
- Release 0.5: Critical bugfixes and reduction of warnings.
- Fixed loadbalancer bug that occurred when inserting only very little data into an octree.
- Fixed bug in extraction of Octree data.
- Fixed color gradient along Z-Axis in viewer.
- Fixed overwrite of Swept-Volume subvolumes via provider in the Viewer.
- Fixed heaps of compiler warnings (Thanks to Felix Mauch).
- Renamed MapTypes to more understandable names.

- Fixed flickering in Visualizer when drawing more then one Octree. Resulted from same race-conditions as above.
- Corrected axis order in visualizer console output.
- Fixed model loading path when not using GPU_VOXELS_MODEL_PATH
- Changed argument handling in command line interface for loading models from PCD only to more general pointcloud files.

V 0.7 (2015-06-10):
===================
- Added URDF parser and interfaces to load ROS robots.
- Added URDF example program with HoLLiE robot model and URDF file.
- Unified API for DH-Parameter and URDF robots.
- Added name lookup to MetaPointClouds.
- Restructured CMake files to generate more descriptive report about missing libs.
